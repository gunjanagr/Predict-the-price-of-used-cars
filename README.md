# Predict the Price of Used Cars

## Description:
This project aims to predict the price of used cars using machine learning techniques. The main language used for this project is Jupyter Notebook.

## Features:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Price prediction based on input features

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Prerequisites:
- Python installed on the system
- Jupyter Notebook installed
- Necessary libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn installed

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/Predict-the-price-of-used-cars.git
```

2. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Configuration:
1. Set up a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file containing the project.

## Usage:
1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('used_cars_dataset.csv')

# Data preprocessing steps
# ...
```

2. Train the machine learning model:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Feature selection and splitting
# ...

# Model training
# ...
```

3. Predict the price of a used car:
```python
# Input features for prediction
# ...

# Use the trained model to predict the price
# ...
```
